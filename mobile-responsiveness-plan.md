### Performance Optimizations

Optimize performance specifically for mobile devices:

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Implement responsive images with srcset
   - Use modern image formats (WebP with fallbacks)
   - Implement lazy loading for images
   - Consider using the Angular NgOptimizedImage directive

2. **Code Splitting**
   - Implement route-based code splitting
   - Lazy load non-critical components
   - Defer loading of below-the-fold content

3. **Critical CSS**
   - Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content
   - Defer non-critical CSS loading
   - Minimize CSS payload for initial load

4. **Service Worker**
   - Implement offline support with service worker
   - Cache static assets for faster subsequent loads
   - Provide offline fallback content

### Testing Approach

Comprehensive testing will be conducted across devices:

1. **Device Testing**
   - Test on real iOS and Android devices
   - Test on various screen sizes (small phone to large tablet)
   - Test with different connection speeds

2. **Browser Testing**
   - Test on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge mobile browsers
   - Test with different browser versions
   - Ensure consistent experience across browsers

3. **Usability Testing**
   - Conduct user testing on mobile devices
   - Gather feedback on mobile experience
   - Identify pain points and areas for improvement
